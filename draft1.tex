\section{Introduction: Why align the muon system?}

CMS has two main tracking systems: a silicon detector for all-purpose
track measurement and a system of muon chambers behind layers of iron,
for identifying and tracking muons.  The silicon tracker, hereafter
simply called the ``tracker,'' is a cylindrical volume around the
interaction point with a 1~m radius, capable of resolving track
momenta with high precision up to several hundred GeV.  The muon
system is a full tracking system on its own, with 18--44 layers of
measurements (depending on polar angle) to robustly identify muons.
However, it also extends the tracker's momentum reach for muons beyond
a TeV, because even the innermost measurements are 4~m from the
interaction point, thereby quadrupling each track's lever arm.

The impact of the muon system on momentum resolution is most
significant above a TeV (Figure) because of the relative precision of
the tracker and muon sensors, and the difficulty of tracking particles
through a scattering medium.  Hits on silicon strips in the tracker
have an intrinsic resolution of $x$--$y$~$\mu$m, while drift tube hits
in the muon barrel and cathode strip hits in the muon endcap have
intrinsic resolutions of about 200~$\mu$m.  Also, low-momentum muons
scatter in the iron, making their direction between measurements
uncertain.  Only very energetic muons with nearly straight
trajectories get an additional benefit from the lever arm the muon
system provides.

However, high-energy muons like these are key to many clean signatures
of physics beyond the Standard Model--- in particular, a dimuon
resonance with a mass above 900~GeV would be striking evidence of new
physics, requiring only about $x$~pb$^{-1}$ of 14~TeV
collisions~[ref].  The discovery potential of such a resonance is
directly proportional to the real resolution of track momentum, which
is a combination of errors from the intrinsic resolution of hits and
incorrect assumptions about the sensors' positions when reconstructing
tracks.  The latter error is known as misalignment, and the
misalignment of each detector element must be minimized to ensure
early discovery of high-energy resonances (Figure).

From the point of view of momentum resolution, some chambers are more
important than others.  The exaggerated track in Figure~Q illustrates
the effect of the non-uniform magnetic field observed by muons passing
through the muon system--- the field strength even changes sign,
reversing the curvature of the track.  This places a limit on the
advantage of extra lever arm: beyond about 5~m, muon system hits no
longer contribute to the shared curvature measurement made by the
tracker and muon system.  Therefore, it is essential to determine the
alignment of the inner chambers well, particularly in the $r\phi$
direction (perpendicular to the beamline), which constrains the
curvature of all muon tracks.

Therefore, a high-quality alignment of the muon system would require
the innermost muon chambers to be better aligned in $r\phi$ than their
intrinsic resolution of 200~$\mu$m, relative to the tracker.  The
other chambers and alignment parameters should be better aligned than
a few times this, about a millimeter.  Rotation angles must also be
aligned to such a degree that they don't displace hits on the far ends
of the chambers, with the same resolution goals.  This document
describes a procedure to align the whole muon system using tracks
measured by the chambers themselves, reaching the desired alignment
goals with $N$~pb$^{-1}$ of collisions data.

\subsection{Geometry of the muon system}

The muon system has two main parts, a barrel circling the interaction
point with drift tubes (DT) and an endcap of cathode strip chambers
(CSC) on each side of the beamline (Figure).  Resistive plate chambers
(RPC) are interleaved between DT and CSC chambers, but these are
low-resolution devices meant for extra redundancy in triggering and
muon identification, not momentum resolution.  DT chambers are mounted
on wheels and CSCs on disks for modular assembly, and within these
structures they are grouped into single-layered rings of chambers
known as stations (labelled in Figure).  Each station has a unique
response to tracks due to its orientation and the quantity of
material that the muons must penetrate to reach it, but within each
station, the response should be identical because of the azimuthal
symmetry of CMS.  We therefore discuss alignment of chambers in each
station individually.

Inside the chambers are 6, 8, or 12 sensitive layers, depending on the
chamber type.  CSCs have 6 layers of cathode strips and wires, each of
which is sensitive to the two-dimensional position of passing muons.
DT chambers in the inner three barrel stations (MB1--3) have 12 layers
of one-dimensional drift tubes, the middle four at a 90-degree angle
with respect to the top and bottom four, to provide measurements in
both directions.  Only the outermost barrel station (MB4) is a
one-dimensional chamber, with 8 layers measuring $r\phi$.

Both chambers and layers are expected to be misaligned, though layer
misalignments are smaller and do not change with time because the
layers have been tightly fastened to the chamber frame.  Layer
misalignments have been under study since the chambers were assembled,
and will be corrected before first collisions data arrive.  We
consider them outside the scope of this document.

Chambers, on the other hand, will physically move every time the CMS
magnetic field increases or decreases, and do not return to the same
positions for a given field strength.  The most extreme case is ME1/1,
the innermost endcap station, where chambers have been observed to
move 1.4~cm when the CMS magnetic field bends the disk that supports
them.  Chambers are mounted on ball-and-socket joints, to ensure that
they rotate rather than distort the shape of the layers inside, so we
can treat them as rigid bodies, floating in 3 translational and 3
rotational degrees of freedom.

\subsection{Methods of alignment}

A system for measuring the geometry of the muon detector was
integrated into its design, such that key positions are continuously
observed by lasers and calipers.  This system, known as the Muon
Hardware Alignment System (MHAS), will determine the geometry of the
muon chambers before any tracks are observed.  Some degrees of freedom
measured by this system are so-called ``weak modes'' of track-based
alignment, and will therefore be dominated by hardware measurements
until very large datasets become available.  Also, only
the hardware system can identify sudden changes in alignment due to
slipping or settling into the magnetic field.  Track-based alignment
methods are limited to large, homogeneous datasets.

However, there are some advantages to track-based alignment, mainly
that the tracks observe parameters which are directly relevant for
reconstruction.  For instance, tracks directly connect sensors in the
tracker to the muon chambers, coaligning the active detector elements
of the two systems, rather than their supporting structures.  To
achieve the same goal, the hardware measurements must be propagated
through a series of mechanical devices, correcting for offsets from
the active elements.  Though track-based alignment is not equally
sensitive to all degrees of freedom, it is most sensitive to degrees
of freedom perpendicular to the tracks, which are exactly the ones
that must be best aligned when reconstructing tracks.

Tracks in the muon system are stochastically deflected due to multiple
scattering of the muons in material, particularly the iron yoke
between stations.  This can lead to deflections on the order of
centimeters for individual tracks, particularly in the outermost
stations and particularly for low-momentum muons.  However, their
distributions are symmetrically broadened without skewing the central
value, reducing the statistical power of track-based alignment but not
biasing it.  More serious are systematic distortions, such as a
mistaken material budget or incorrect map of the magnetic field, which
we study in detail.

\section{Overview of the MuonHIP algorithm}

Alignment using tracks is usually complicated by the fact that it is
coupled with track-fitting: the optimal alignment is given by the mean
distance between tracks and their associated hits, but the best-fit of
the tracks to those hits depends on the assumed detector geometry.
This circular dependence is a major issue when aligning a
self-contained system like the silicon tracker, but the coupling can
be broken when aligning a muon tracking system next to the
high-precision silicon tracker.  Assuming that the silicon tracker has
been correctly aligned, we can simply extend tracker-fitted tracks
into the muon system and align muon chambers to them.  This would
accomplish two goals at once: relative alignment of the muon chambers,
particularly along the lines of sight of tracks, and alignment of the
whole muon system relative to the tracker.

This procedure is a special case of one of the algorithms used to
align the tracker, the Hits and Impact Points (HIP) algorithm, which
aligns components so as to minimize the distance between detector hits
and the intersection of a track on the detector surface, known as an
impact point.  To reduce sensitivity to the initial misalignment,
tracks are refit with Alignment Parameter Errors (APE), which is an
alignment uncertainty added in quadrature with the intrinsic
uncertainty of each hit in the track-refit.  Typically, the HIP
algorithm is used iteratively, refitting tracks with smaller APEs and
correcting the sensor positions at each step, slowly converging to a
solution that optimizes track-fits and aligned positions
simultaneously.  In our case, we refit tracks with a very large APE in
the muon system (10~m), no APE in the tracker, and align the muon
chambers to these ``tracker-fitted'' tracks in one iteration.  Thus,
we can accomplish our decoupled alignment using the same software
tools as the tracker alignment community, because our procedure is
implemented as a special case.

To summarize, our variant of the HIP procedure (MuonHIP) is as
follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Collect a set of tracks with their associated hits in the
  tracker and the muon system.
\item Set APEs in the tracker to 0 and APEs in the muon system to~$\infty$~(10~m).
\item Refit the tracks with these artificial hit uncertainties; track
  parameters are dominated by tracker measurements, completely
  insensitive to muon chamber positions, yet muon hits are included on
  tracks and residuals may be calculated.
\item Align muon chambers to these tracks, shifting and rotating them
  to minimize the residual (track position minus hit position) of
  muon hits.
\end{enumerate}
A MuonHIP alignment is completed in one pass over the dataset because
the resulting geometry is only a function of the tracker geometry and
the set of tracks, not the muon geometry.  We check our procedure by
running it a second time and verifying that the second-iteration
corrections are nearly zero.

\subsection{Coordinate transformations and corrections}

The static position and orientation of each muon chamber can be viewed
as an active transformation from a single global coordinate system to
local chamber coordinates.  Hits are reconstructed relative to a
reference point in the chamber from charge and timing measurements on
hits and wires, knowing nothing of how the whole chamber is oriented
in space.  Tracks are fitted in a global coordinate system defined by
the tracker, and must be transformed to the chamber's local
coordinates for comparison with the hit.  If the chamber is
misaligned, the assumed coordinate transformation will lead to biases
in the residuals between track impact points and hits, for instance, a
millimeter misalignment in the chamber's local $x$ direction would
cause the $x$ residuals to be systematically offset by one millimeter.

To talk about these parameters, we'll need a coordinate system: define
the $x$ and $y$ directions to be the layer's measurement plane, with
$x$ at the center of the chamber corresponding to $r\phi$, sensitive
to track curvature.  The $y$ direction is parallel to the beamline for
DT chambers in the barrel and is pointing radially away from the
beamline at the center of CSC chambers in the endcaps.  The $z$
direction, completing a right-handed coordinate system, is always
perpendicular to the layer's measurement plane, radial for
DT chambers and parallel to the beamline for CSCs.

Rotations are described by three angles, $\phi_x$, $\phi_y$, and
$\phi_z$, which are rotations around the local $x$, $y$, and $z$ axes,
respectively.  The order of operations and signs of the angles are
defined as follows: the active rotation matrix from local to global
coordinates is
\begin{equation}
{\bf R} = \left(\begin{array}{c c c}
 1 &         0 &         0 \\
 0 &         \cos\phi_x &  \sin\phi_x \\
 0 &        -\sin\phi_x &  \cos\phi_x
\end{array}\right) \,
\left(\begin{array}{c c c}
 \cos\phi_y &  0 &        -\sin\phi_y \\
 0 &         1 &         0 \\
 \sin\phi_y &  0 &         \cos\phi_y
\end{array}\right) \,
\left(\begin{array}{c c c}
 \cos\phi_z &  \sin\phi_z &  0 \\
 -\sin\phi_z &  \cos\phi_z &  0 \\
 0 &         0 &         1
\end{array}\right) \mbox{.}
\end{equation}
All of these definitions are illustrated in Figure~Q.

The relationships between these parameters and global coordinates
(such as identifying $x$ with $r\phi$) apply only to chambers starting
in the design geometry--- in general, they are approximate because the
parameters describe a correction from one assumed geometry to
another.  Discussing the geometry in terms of corrections gives us the
convenience of working with small numbers in which zero always means
no correction.  Sometimes, however, we'll need to know the absolute
position in space.  Defining the initial position and rotation as
$\vec{P_0}$ and ${\bf R_0}$, respectively, and the alignment corrections as
$\vec{P_c}$ and ${\bf R_c}$, the corrected position and rotation of a
chamber is
\begin{equation}
\vec{P} = ({\bf R_0})^{-1} \cdot \vec{P_c} + \vec{P_0}
\mbox{\hspace{0.5 cm}and\hspace{0.5 cm}} {\bf R} = {\bf R_c} \cdot {\bf R_0} \mbox{.}
\end{equation}
Rotations are always applied first, so that absolute chamber positions
are specified in global coordinates.

\subsection{How to align chambers to tracks}

Though we have said that the objective of the HIP algorithm is to
minimize residuals between tracks and hits, we have not yet explained
how this can be done, given a collection of residuals on a chamber.
If a chamber were misaligned purely in one direction, $x$ for example,
the $x$ residual of all hits would be offset from zero by the same
amount, so the alignment correction should be the weighted mean of the
$x$ residuals distribution, negated.
\begin{equation}
\mbox{Alignment correction} = -\frac{b}{A} \pm \frac{1}{A} \mbox{ with } A =
\sum_{\mbox{\scriptsize all hits}} \frac{1}{{\sigma_r}^2}
\mbox{ and } b = \sum_{\mbox{\scriptsize all hits}} \frac{r}{{\sigma_r}^2} \mbox{,}
\label{weighted_mean}
\end{equation}
where $r$ is the residual (track minus hit) and $\sigma_r$ is its
uncertainty, for each hit.  It is important to propagate hit
uncertainties because they are very inhomogeneous in the muon system:
intrinsic uncertainties can vary by factors of several hundred percent,
depending on whether the hit passed through or between cathode strips
or wire groups in the CSCs, and how close the track approached each DT
wire.  Performing a weighted mean, rather than a simple mean, sharpens
alignment resolution by more than a factor of two.

All 6 rigid body degrees of freedom can be determined from two
residuals measurements, $\vec{r}$ = $r_x$ and $r_y$, by exploiting
trends in the residuals distribution as a function of the intersection
between the track and the layer plane.  For instance, misalignments in
$\phi_z$ introduce linear trends in $r_x(y)$ and $r_y(x)$, which are
orthogonal to the constant-offset effects of simple translations in
$x$ and $y$.  The alignment corrections, which we'll describe with a
6-component vector $\vec{q}$, can all be determined at once through
the 6$\times$2 Jacobian matrix $(\partial q/\partial r)$.  The
alignment corrections still look like a weighted mean:
\begin{equation}
\vec{q} = -{\bf A}^{-1} \cdot \vec{b} \ \pm\  {\bf A}^{-1}
\label{alignment_corrections1}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
{\bf A} = \sum_{\mbox{\scriptsize all hits}} \,
  \left(\frac{\partial q}{\partial r}\right) \,
  \left({\sigma_r}^2\right)^{-1} \,
  \left(\frac{\partial q}{\partial r}\right)^T
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
\vec{b} = \sum_{\mbox{\scriptsize all hits}} \,
  \left(\frac{\partial q}{\partial r}\right) \,
  \left({\sigma_r}^2\right)^{-1} \,
  \vec{r} \mbox{.}
\label{alignment_corrections2}
\end{equation}
If we wish to fix some degrees of freedom, for reasons described in
the next subsection, we would simply lower the dimensionality of
$\vec{q}$ (or, equivalently, set rows of $(\partial q/\partial r)$ to
zero).

Since there is no circular dependence between track-fitting and
alignment in the MuonHIP procedure, this one correction is nearly
sufficient to optimize the placement of all muon chambers.  The only
remaining distortion due to the method derives from the fact that
rotating a layer plane changes the point where a track intersects it
in global 3-space.  This means that there's a tiny curvature in the
$\vec{r} \times \vec{t}$ manifold which we project onto parameter
space ($\vec{t}$~are the track parameters), so multiplication by
$(\partial q/\partial r)$ is just a linear approximation to the full
transformation from $\vec{r}\times\vec{t}$ to $\vec{q}$.  We can
easily correct this by iterating a second time, recomputing the track
impact points with the first-iteration geometry, obtaining a set of
corrections $\vec{q'}$ on top of the first iteration $\vec{q}$.
However, these second order corrections are negligible and errors from
detector effects are more of a concern.

\subsection{Degrees of freedom and weak modes}

Though all 6 degrees of freedom can in principle be derived from a
system of 2 residuals and 5 track parameters, some of these are
statistically limited.  The most obvious example of a limited degree
of freedom, or weak mode, is alignment parallel to the line of sight
of tracks:~if all tracks that pass through a chamber are straight and
parallel, nothing can be said about the position of that chamber along
the line parallel to the tracks because motion along that line leaves
the residuals and impact points invariant (Figure?).  Though there is
a variation in track angles across each chamber's surface, this
variation is small for tracks that come from the interaction point and
tends to be confused with $\phi_x$ and $\phi_z$ because it's strongly
correlated with $y$ (see next paragraph).  Unless we exploit a
sufficiently large sample of non-interaction tracks, we will need to
fix at least one coordinate, meaning that we would obtain the value
from hardware measurements and not update it in the track-based
alignment process.

The line of sight of tracks from the interaction point is a linear
combination of the chambers' local $y$ and $z$ directions (with a tiny
$x$ component if misaligned), though mostly in the $z$ direction,
especially in the central barrel wheel.  To simplify interpretation of
the results, we would lock the $z$ position of chambers if we had to
fix one translational degree of freedom, allowing them to float in $x$
and $y$.  If the initial $z$ positions are incorrect, chambers would
align to $y$ positions that preserve the straightness of straight
tracks, as illustrated in Figure~Q.  These are not the true $y$
positions, but they minimize error in momentum reconstruction,
especially for the very straight tracks that motivate muon alignment.

The $\phi_x$ and $\phi_y$ angles are also weakly determined because
they are second-order in residuals trends.  Each rotation angle
introduces an approximately-linear dependence in residuals across the
layer surface because it rotates impact points around an arc whose
length is proportional to the distance from the rotation center (see
Figure~Q).  In the case of $\phi_z$, rotation in the plane of the
layer, the slope of $r_x(y)$ and $r_y(x)$ near the center is
proportional to $\sin\phi_z$ ($\partial r_x / \partial y |_{y=0}
\propto \partial r_y / \partial x |_{x=0} \propto \sin\phi_z$,
Figure~Q-c), so knowledge of this slope gives us first-order knowledge
of $\phi_z$.  The first-order effects of $\phi_x$ and $\phi_y$
rotations are out of the plane of the layer, and are therefore not
measured by tracks perpendicular to the layer plane (a reasonable
approximation for this argument).  Therefore, our access to $\phi_x$
and $\phi_y$ is limited to $\partial r_y / \partial y|_{y=0} \propto 1
- \cos\phi_x$ (Figure~Q-a) and $\partial r_x / \partial x |_{x=0}
\propto 1 - \cos\phi_y$ (Figure~Q-b), which are second-order.

We should also consider that the muon chambers were designed to
measure the $p_T$ and $\phi$ of tracks with higher precision than
$\eta$, because $p_T$ is essential for setting the momentum scale of
energetic muons.  Therefore, local $x$ is always the best measurement,
especially in the CSCs where $x$ is determined with high-precision
cathode strips and $y$ with coarse groups of ganged wires.  Thus, the
$x$ positions will be better determined than $y$, and the $\phi_y$
angles will be better determined than $\phi_x$.

\section{Identifying alignment quality with data}

\section{Concluding remarks}



%% \section{Introduction}

%% The positions and orientations of CMS muon chambers must be well
%% understood for accurate measurements of muon momentum, especially for
%% muon tracks with energies on the order of
%% 1~TeV~\cite{alignment_needed_for_tev}.  In addition to monitoring
%% these parameters with a dedicated apparatus~\cite{hardware_alignment},
%% we will also measure the alignment using tracks identified by the
%% chambers themselves using the HIP algorithm.  This track-based
%% alignment has several advantages, the most important being that tracks
%% reveal the positions of the sensitive elements directly, rather than
%% through the structure that supports them, and the precision on each
%% degree of freedom is proportional to that which is needed for track
%% reconstruction.

%% The fundamental difficulty in aligning any detector with the tracks it
%% observes is that the process of fitting tracks depends on the assumed
%% position of the detector.  One immediate consequence of this circular
%% dependence is that the global position of the whole detector can never
%% be determined with tracks alone.  Therefore, our emphasis will be on
%% relative alignments of one system to another, usually the chambers of
%% the muon system (barrel and endcap) relative to the silicon tracker,
%% but also muon chambers relative to one another.

%% \subsection{The HIP algorithm}

%% The HIP algorithm (Hits and Impact Points,~\cite{hip_algorithm})
%% addresses the interdependence of track fitting with alignment by
%% alternating between the two in an iterative approach.  The alignment
%% step is very simple: chambers are moved in such a way as to make the
%% weighted mean of their residuals distribution zero before refitting.
%% (A residual is the difference between the track's extrapolation to the
%% detector surface, called the impact point, and the measured hit.)

%% To illustrate this method, let's consider the algorithm in a
%% one-dimensional case.  At each iteration, the correction to the
%% $x$ position of the chamber is equal to the weighted mean of the $x$
%% residual distribution, negated.
%% \begin{equation}
%% \mbox{Alignment correction} = -\frac{b}{A} \pm \frac{1}{A} \mbox{ with } A =
%% \sum_{\mbox{\scriptsize all hits}} \frac{1}{{\sigma_r}^2}
%% \mbox{ and } b = \sum_{\mbox{\scriptsize all hits}} \frac{r}{{\sigma_r}^2} \mbox{,}
%% \label{weighted_mean}
%% \end{equation}
%% where $r$ is the residual (track minus hit) and $\sigma_r$
%% is its uncertainty, for each hit.

%% In general, each hit in the real detector measures one or two
%% dimensions in its sensitive plane (residuals $\vec{r}$ = $r_x$ and
%% $r_y$ with covariance matrix ${\sigma_r}^2$) which are transformed to the
%% (at most) six-dimensional space of local alignment corrections
%% $\vec{q}$ = $x$, $y$, $z$, $\phi_x$, $\phi_y$, and $\phi_z$ through an
%% (at most) 6$\times$2 Jacobian matrix $(\partial q/\partial r)$.  (We
%% can fix degrees of freedom that are not well determined, reducing the
%% dimensionality of the problem.)  The alignment corrections still look
%% like a weighted mean:
%% \begin{equation}
%% \mbox{Alignment corrections} = -{\bf A}^{-1} \cdot \vec{b} \ \pm\  {\bf A}^{-1}
%% \label{alignment_corrections1}
%% \end{equation}
%% where
%% \begin{equation}
%% {\bf A} = \sum_{\mbox{\scriptsize all hits}} \,
%%   \left(\frac{\partial q}{\partial r}\right) \,
%%   \left({\sigma_r}^2\right)^{-1} \,
%%   \left(\frac{\partial q}{\partial r}\right)^T
%% \end{equation}
%% and
%% \begin{equation}
%% \vec{b} = \sum_{\mbox{\scriptsize all hits}} \,
%%   \left(\frac{\partial q}{\partial r}\right) \,
%%   \left({\sigma_r}^2\right)^{-1} \,
%%   \vec{r} \mbox{.}
%% \label{alignment_corrections2}
%% \end{equation}
%% Since the matrix inversions are at most 6$\times$6, most
%% of the computational effort in the HIP algorithm is spent re-fitting
%% tracks and producing updated residuals distributions between
%% iterations.

%% \subsection{The geometry of the muon system}

%% The muon system is composed of a barrel of drift tube chambers and two
%% endcaps of cathode strip chambers surrounding all other CMS detectors
%% (see Figure~\ref{muon_system_labeled}).

%% \begin{figure}
%% \begin{center}
%% \includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{intro/muon_system_labeled.pdf}
%% \end{center}

%% \caption{\label{muon_system_labeled} A quarter-view of CMS,
%%   highlighting the muon barrel (MB) and endcap (ME) stations.}
%% \end{figure}

%% A drift tube is an anode wire in a cylindrical, gas-filled tube, held
%% at high voltage with respect to the outer surface of the tube.  It
%% measures the distance of closest approach of a charged track to the
%% wire through the time needed for electrons to drift from gas atoms,
%% ionized by the track's passage, to the wire \cite{drift_tubes}.

%% Drift tube chambers (DTs) are rectangular sandwiches of 8--12 layers
%% of drift tubes.  Each layer measures the intersection of the track
%% with the layer plane in one dimension: $x$ in local chamber
%% coordinates for the first four layers (superlayer 1) and the last four
%% layers (superlayer 2 or 3).  Chambers with 12 layers (all but MB 4:
%% see Figure~\ref{muon_system_labeled}) have a third superlayer in the
%% middle that measures $y$ in local chamber coordinates, being rotated a
%% 90$^\circ$ angle with respect to superlayers 1 and 3.  In global CMS
%% coordinates, the DTs' local $x$ corresponds roughly with $r\phi$, the
%% polar angle around the beamline, and local $y$ corresponds exactly with
%% global $z$, the direction along the beamline.  The layers are stacked
%% in local $z$.

%% There are 250 DTs: 4 stations in global $r$ times 5 wheels in global
%% $z$ times 12--14 sectors in global $\phi$.  (Only MB 4 has 14
%% sectors.)

%% A cathode strip is a band of conducting material painted on a layer
%% plane, measuring the intersection of a track through that plane by
%% comparing the charges collected on neighboring strips.  In the cathode
%% strip chambers (CSCs), 6 trapezoidal layers of cathode planes
%% alternate with layers of anode wires.  The strips measure the track
%% intersection point along a dimension which is nearly collinear with
%% local $x$: ``nearly'' because the strips fan from the narrow end of
%% the trapezoid to the wide end, and only the central strip measures $x$
%% exactly (see Figure~\ref{csc_chamber}).  The wires measure the same
%% intersection point in the local $y$ direction.  Just as for the DTs,
%% local $x$ corresponds roughly with $r\phi$ in the global CMS
%% coordinate system, but for CSCs, local $y$ corresponds roughly with
%% global $r$.  The CSC layers are also stacked in local $z$, but in
%% decreasing order (layer 1 is ``above'' layer 6 in $z$).

%% \begin{figure}
%% \begin{center}
%% \includegraphics[width=0.3\linewidth]{intro/csc_chamber.png}
%% \end{center}

%% \caption{\label{csc_chamber} A CSC chamber: cathode strips measure the
%%   local $x$ direction (global $r\phi$) and wire groups measure the
%%   local $y$ direction (global $r$).}
%% \end{figure}

%% For alignment purposes, there are 540 CSC chambers, not all of which
%% are physically distinct.  Chambers in ME 1/1 (see
%% Figure~\ref{muon_system_labeled}) have a unique geometry: they are
%% doubled (12 active layers) in such a way that each may be treated as two
%% chambers~\cite{doubling_up_me11}.  In the geometry description used by
%% track reconstruction, half of each double-chamber is said to belong to
%% a new station, ME 1/4.  We will use the same convention.

%% The intrinsic resolution of a DT hit ($x$ or $y$) is approximately
%% 300~$\mu$m~\cite{intrinsic_dt_resolution}.  The intrinsic resolution
%% of a CSC hit can be as small as $\sim$200~$\mu$m in local $x$ if the
%% track intersection is between strips, $\sim$??~$\mu$m otherwise.
%% (Strips are staggered from one layer to the next to guarantee that
%% about half of the hits will have optimum precision in $x$.)  Local $y$
%% resolution is about 1~cm for CSCs because groups of neighboring wires
%% are ganged together to make read-out
%% feasible~\cite{intrinsic_csc_resolution}.  Since the hit uncertainties
%% loosely distinguish between different types of hits, error propagation
%% in Equation~\ref{alignment_corrections2} is crucial: we must align to
%% the weighted mean, rather than the unweighted mean.

%% The goal of track-based alignment is to measure the positions of each
%% chamber with a better precision than the intrinsic resolution.  We
%% will treat each chamber as a rigid body; layers and superlayers have
%% been firmly locked in place.  However, the positions of internal
%% elements may differ from their design geometry, so we will use
%% measurements of DT layers and superlayers provided by the DT alignment
%% group~\cite{dt_alignment_group} and CSC layers from the CSC alignment
%% group~\cite{csc_alignment_group}.  Additionally, we will refine the
%% CSC layer determination with a special track-based alignment run,
%% described below.

%% DT and CSC chambers are allowed to slide and rotate when the 4~T
%% magnetic field turns on and off (several millimeters in the CSC case),
%% to protect their internal structure from stresses from the enormous
%% force of the field~\cite{slide_in_field}.  Therefore, chamber
%% positions are always treated as floating parameters.  Additionally,
%% the DT chambers are mounted on 5 free-standing wheels and the CSC
%% chambers are mounted on 4 free-standing disks for each endcap (total
%% of 8).  These can slide open and closed (on air and grease pads) to
%% provide access to CMS's inner detectors.  As a result, the wheels and
%% disks are a source of correlated alignment error, observed to be
%% as large as 7~mm.  To avoid individually aligning all chambers on a
%% wheel or disk by what is really a combined motion (for instance, 7~mm
%% to the left), we will first align the wheels and disks as units,
%% followed by the chambers.

%% \section{General configuration and organization of studies}

%% \subsection{Nominal alignment procedure}

%% In this section, we describe the nominal procedure that is used as a
%% standard of comparison for systematics studies.  The nominal procedure
%% is not necessarily the best procedure: in the course of our studies,
%% we find improvements on our initial best guess and present the optimal
%% procedure at the end of each section as a recommendation.

%% The nominal procedure is conducted in two parts: first we align the
%% barrel wheels and endcap disks relative to the CMS silicon tracker,
%% then we align the individual chambers, also using the silicon tracker
%% as a reference.  We studied relative alignment of muon chambers
%% without an external reference, but present that in a later section.
%% We also discuss procedures for CSC layer alignment (the third
%% alignment step) in its own section.

%% Nominal alignment requires a source of high-$p_T$ muons from the
%% 14~TeV $p$-$p$ collision vertex.  We assume that the rate of this
%% source is the rate of $W\to\mu\nu$ and $Z\to\mu\mu$ muons (effectively
%% 6.6~nb and 0.5~nb, respectively, when branching fractions and
%% acceptance are included) in collisions at $2\times
%% 10^{32}$~/cm$^2$/s luminosity (0.2~nb$^{-1}$/s).  In our simulations,
%% we only generate $Z\to\mu\mu$ muons, and extrapolate to equal numbers
%% of muon tracks.  In a later section, we explore the effects of
%% aligning with inclusively-selected muons and larger samples of
%% lower-$p_T$ muons.  We also postpone discussions of alignments with
%% other sources, such as beam-halo muons from the accelerator, and
%% the results from cosmic ray alignments to a later section.

%% \subsection{Initial conditions: the misalignment scenario}

%% To study our alignment procedure in Monte Carlo, we must begin with a
%% realistically misaligned detector.  Wheels, disks, chambers, and CSC
%% layers are misaligned once by random translations and rotations at the
%% beginning of the alignment process, drawn from Gaussian distributions.
%% Subdetectors, such as chambers on a wheel or disk, or layers in a
%% chamber, are displaced relative to the displaced superstructure,
%% thereby introducing correlations among subdetectors on the same
%% superstructure.  The standard deviations of the Gaussians used to
%% generate misalignments are given in Table~\ref{misalignments}.  Most
%% values are conservative estimates, the exception being the magnitudes
%% for CSC layers, taken from measurements with cosmic
%% rays~\cite{karoly_layer_misalignments}.  These misalignments are all
%% larger than the 10~pb$^{-1}$ projection (Muon10InvPbScenario) used for
%% misalignment studies in physics analyses.

%% \end{center}

%% \caption{\label{misalignments} Standard deviations of the Gaussians
%% used to generate misalignments as a starting point for alignment
%% studies.  Values for CSC layers come from measurements of a subset
%% with cosmic rays; the rest are conservative estimates.}
%% \end{figure}

%% We align the muon system relative to the silicon tracker by
%% extrapolating tracks from the tracker to the muon system.  This makes
%% the muon alignment resolution dependent on the tracker misalignment, a
%% dependence which we will quantify.  For the nominal procedure, we use
%% the short-term tracker misalignment scenario intended for misalignment
%% studies in physics analyses (TrackerShortTermScenario).

%% \subsection{Track refitting procedure}

%% At each iteration of the HIP algorithm, tracks selected for alignment
%% are refit (from the outermost hits inward) under the current alignment
%% conditions.  This allows misalignments and alignment corrections to be
%% propagated into the residual distributions, as residuals are
%% calculated from the tracks' intersections with the assumed positions of
%% the detector planes.  We also have the opportunity to reweight the
%% hits used in the track fit through the detectors' alignment parameter
%% errors (APEs).  The inverse weight of each hit ($\sigma_r$ in
%% Equation~\ref{weighted_mean}) is given by
%% \begin{equation}
%% {\sigma_r}^2 = {\sigma_{\mbox{\scriptsize track}}}^2 +
%% {\sigma_{\mbox{\scriptsize hit}}}^2 + {\sigma_{\mbox{\scriptsize APE}}}^2
%% \label{hit_uncertainty}
%% \end{equation}
%% where $\sigma_{\mbox{\scriptsize track}}$ is the uncertainty in the
%% track projection, $\sigma_{\mbox{\scriptsize hit}}$ is the intrinsic
%% hit uncertainty, and $\sigma_{\mbox{\scriptsize APE}}$ is the
%% alignment parameter error.

%% To decouple track-fitting from alignment, we severely deweight the
%% hits in the muon system by giving them each a
%% $\sigma_{\mbox{\scriptsize APE}}$ of 10~cm.  Track fits are thus
%% dominated by the silicon tracker, but muon chamber residuals are still
%% calculated and track fits are still sensitive to large kinks from
%% multiple scattering.  With this technique, alignment reaches its final
%% accuracy in one iteration, because the fitted positions of tracks are
%% largely undisturbed by moving the muon chambers.

%% It is important to verify that the optimum placement of muon chambers
%% is not a function of $\sigma_{\mbox{\scriptsize APE}}$.  For instance,
%% we might imagine that one detector geometry optimizes residual
%% distributions when muon hits are insignificant in the track-fit, and
%% another geometry optimizes residual distributions in standard track
%% reconstruction.  We check for this by decreasing
%% $\sigma_{\mbox{\scriptsize APE}}$ from 10~cm to a negligible value,
%% superexponentially with iteration number (according to
%% \begin{equation}
%% \sigma_{\mbox{\scriptsize APE}} = (10\mbox{ cm}) \, \exp\left(-\frac{i^3}{10}\right)
%% \end{equation}
%% where $i$ is the number of completed iterations).
%% After three iterations, $\sigma_{\mbox{\scriptsize APE}}$ falls
%% below $\sigma_{\mbox{\scriptsize hit}}$ and track reconstruction
%% becomes equivalent to the standard offline reconstruction algorithm
%% (see Figure~\ref{residuals_by_iteration}).  As we will later see,
%% aligned positions after the fourth iteration are the same as aligned
%% positions in the first three iterations, validating our procedure.

%%   three iterations to standard reconstruction from iteration 4

%% \section{Wheel and disk alignment}

%% In a wheel/disk alignment, the alignment parameters are all expressed
%% in global coordinates: $x$ is parallel to the floor in the CMS cavern,
%% $y$ points upward, and $z$ is along the beamline.  The most sensitive
%% parameter is $\phi_z$, rotation around the beamline, since this
%% corresponds to the most sensitive measurement dimension in all
%% chambers.  It is also the most relevant for accurately reconstructing
%% muon $p_T$.

%% The second-most sensitive parameters are $x$ and $y$.  The $x$
%% alignment is dominated by the chambers on the top and bottom of each
%% wheel/disk, and $y$ is dominated by chambers on the sides because the
%% local $x$ measurements of each chamber are better than the local $y$
%% measurements.  Wheels are directly sensitive to their $z$ positions,
%% but disks are only sensitive through imprecise local $y$ measurements
%% times $\cot\theta$, where $\theta$ is the azimuthal angle of the
%% tracks with respect to the beamline.  In the nominal wheel/disk
%% alignment, only $x$, $y$, and $\phi_z$ are allowed to float.

%% \subsection{Nominal results and consistency checks}

%% The left-hand plot of Figure~\ref{phiz_conv} presents the result of a
%% typical wheel/disk alignment: $\phi_z$~for each of the 13 wheels and
%% disks starts with an $\mathcal{O}(\mbox{1 mrad})$ misalignment and is
%% brought within $\mathcal{O}(\mbox{0.2 mrad})$ of the correct alignment in
%% the first iteration.  The geometry doesn't change significantly
%% between iterations 3 and 4, so the alignment is not dependent on
%% $\sigma_{\mbox{\scriptsize APE}}$.

%% \begin{figure}
%% \begin{center}
%% \includegraphics[height=0.45\linewidth, angle=90]{disk_alignment/phiz_conv_nominal.pdf}
%% \includegraphics[height=0.45\linewidth, angle=90]{disk_alignment/phiz_conv_barrel_roll.pdf}
%% \end{center}

%% \caption{\label{phiz_conv} Left: convergence of $\phi_z$ as a function
%%   of iteration.  Right: a simulation with the tracker rotated 1~mrad.}
%% \end{figure}

%% In this simulation and most alignment simulations presented in this
%% note, the correct geometry that the alignment procedure should tend
%% toward is the ideal, or design geometry of the detector.  The same is
%% not necessarily true in real alignments with data.  To be sure that
%% the alignment procedure is not artificially tending toward the ideal
%% geometry, we rotated the tracker by 1~mrad, making the correct
%% geometry for each wheel and disk offset from ideal by a 1~mrad
%% $\phi_z$ rotation.  The result of this test is presented on the
%% right-hand side of Figure~\ref{phiz_conv}.  All of the wheels and
%% disks correctly tend toward 1~mrad instead of 0.

%% Thirteen wheels and disks is not a sufficiently large statistical
%% sample to determine the accuracy of the alignment procedure.  We
%% therefore repeat the exercise 10 times with different random starting
%% positions for all wheels, disks, chambers, and CSC layers in each
%% trial.  (The tracker alignment is the same in each trial.)  The
%% positions of 13$\times$10 aligned detectors are histogrammed, fit, and
%% tabulated in Figure~\ref{nominal_fits}.  Resolution in $x$ and $y$ is
%% 1.31~$\pm$~0.12~mm and resolution in $\phi_z$ is 0.20~$\pm$~0.02~mrad.
%% We prefer this method for determining alignment resolutions over the
%% precision calculated by Equation~\ref{alignment_corrections1}, which
%% assumes correct track fits (no tracker misalignment) and depends
%% strongly on one's choice of $\sigma_{\mbox{\scriptsize APE}}$.

%% \caption{\label{nominal_fits} Aligned positions of all wheels and
%%   disks in 10 trials, randomizing the initial muon geometry with each
%%   trial.}
%% \end{figure}

%% \subsection{Dependence on tracker alignment}

%% Track-fits were provided by the silicon tracker, so it is natural to
%% ask how muon alignment resolution depends on tracker misalignment.  We
%% repeated the above analysis (muon alignment in 10 trials) for an ideal
%% tracker, twice the nominal short-term tracker misalignment, five times
%% and ten times the tracker misalignment.  This dependence is plotted in
%% black in Figure~\ref{vstracker}: the tracker must be 3.8~times more
%% misaligned than expected to degrade muon alignment by a factor of~2.

%% \begin{figure}
%% \begin{center}
%% \includegraphics[height=0.75\linewidth, angle=90]{disk_alignment/vstracker2.pdf}
%% \end{center}

%% \caption{\label{vstracker} Dependence of muon alignment resolution on
%%   tracker misalignment, with (black) and without (red) internal
%%   misalignments (chambers and CSC layers).  The horizontal axis is a
%%   scale factor applied to tracker misalignment: 0 is an ideal tracker
%%   and 1 is the nominal short-term scenario.  The vertical axis is
%%   $\phi_z$ resolution.}
%% \end{figure}

%% One might conjecture that the variance in the aligned positions of
%% wheels and disks is dominated by internal misalignments: the
%% misaligned chamber positions that our wheel/disk procedure cannot
%% correct.  In that case, the accuracy of $\phi_z$ is a function of the
%% ratio of tracker misalignment to internal muon misalignment, and the
%% latter was chosen ad-hoc!  We therefore repeated the study with no
%% internal misalignments in the muon wheels and disks, and found that
%% the the curve is not greatly changed (plotted in red in
%% Figure~\ref{vstracker}).  Since the nominal internal misalignments
%% were conservative, the dependence of $\phi_z$ resolution on tracker
%% misalignment is somewhere between the red curve and the black curve
%% (closer to the black curve).

%% \subsection{Required integrated luminosity}

%% The wheel/disk alignment procedure requires very few muons to reach
%% its final accuracy.  Even with deweighted muon chambers, the
%% track-by-track residual distribution is 3~mm wide (see iteration 3 in
%% Figure~\ref{residuals_by_iteration}).  In principle, the wheel and
%% disk positions can reach a 1~mm accuracy with 10 tracks per detector,
%% though 10 tracks aren't guaranteed to be optimally distributed in
%% $\phi$.  We repeated the nominal procedure with 250, 500, 1000, and
%% 2000 tracks, obtaining consistent results in each trial.  To improve
%% alignment beyond the millimeter scale, it is necessary to allow chambers to
%% float.

%% \subsection{Dependence on number of free parameters}

%% The nominal procedure, in which only $x$, $y$, and $\phi_z$ are
%% allowed to float in the alignment, is overly cautious.  Three out of
%% the eight superlayers in each barrel wheel measure the global $z$ of
%% hits directly, so we should at least let the $z$ positions of wheels
%% float.  Moreover, $\phi_x$ and $\phi_y$ orientation can be determined
%% from differences in $z$ position between the top and bottom chambers
%% (for $\phi_x$) and the left and right chambers (for $\phi_y$).  We
%% therefore get the best overall alignment by letting all 6 parameters
%% float for barrel wheels and only 3 parameters ($x$, $y$, and $\phi_z$)
%% for endcap disks.  Allowing more degrees of freedom for the disks
%% degrades their $z$, $\phi_x$, or $\phi_y$ alignment beyond the initial
%% configuration without aiding the alignment of any other parameters.

%% In Figure~\ref{alldt_3csc}, we present results for the 6-parameter
%% wheel, 3-parameter disk alignment.  The $x$ and $y$ resolutions are
%% 0.71~$\pm$~0.04~mm, $z$ resolution is 0.89~$\pm$~0.11~mm, $\phi_x$ and
%% $\phi_y$ resolutions are 0.20~$\pm$~0.02~mrad, and $\phi_z$ resolution
%% is 0.11~$\pm$~0.01~mrad.

%% \begin{figure}
%% \includegraphics[height=\linewidth, angle=90]{disk_alignment/alldt_3csc.pdf}

%% \caption{\label{alldt_3csc} Optimal wheel/disk alignment, in which all
%%   6 parameters float for barrel wheels but only $x$, $y$, and $\phi_z$
%%   for endcap disks.  Note that 13 alignables $\times$ 10 trials are
%%   presented for $x$, $y$, and $\phi_z$, but only 5 alignables $\times$
%%   10 trials for $z$, $\phi_x$, and $\phi_y$.}
%% \end{figure}

%% \subsection{Recommended wheel/disk alignment configuration}

%% The 6-parameter wheel, 3-parameter disk alignment with at least 300
%% muons and 1 or 2 iterations is our recommended procedure for wheel and
%% disk alignment.  (The second iteration improves resolution by about
%% 5\%.)  In early data, we will want to repeat some of the above tests
%% to make sure that data behaves as well as Monte Carlo.

%% \section{-------- Old organization below this line; not necessarily
%%   consistent with new organization --------}

%% \section{Nominal procedure}

%% We will first describe the nominal alignment procedure.  This is the
%% procedure by which routine alignment corrections are obtained, and the
%% point of comparison for systematics studies.

%% \subsection{Wheel and disk granularity}

%% The first step in the procedure, as explained above, is to align the
%% largest level of granularity: wheels in the barrel and disks in the
%% endcap.

%% \subsection{Chamber-by-chamber}

%% default, standard of comparison

%% 10 pb$^{-1}$ of high $p_T$ tracks (from $Z$'s and $W$'s)

%% number of hits cuts on tracks, pull cut on hits

%% Initial misalignment: the Muon10InvPbScenario with residual layer
%% misalignments (to be determined from layer alignment studies)

%% chamber-by-chamber (CSC and DT) x, phiy, phiz float?  can we relax
%% this, letting y and phix float, too?  Not for DT station 4, of course...

%% globalMuon APE scheme: starts large, descends rapidly, converges
%% in a few iterations

%% standAloneMuon APE scheme: less steep, but relevant

%% \section{Accuracy and Precision}

%% output alignment parameter uncertainties (are they broken?  why
%% are they $\sim$4 times too big?): do they scale with residual
%% misalignment?

%% if not, is there any other way to identify chambers with poor
%% convergence?  do they have fewer hits?

%% \section{Performance issues}

%% How does this scale with number of tracks (convert to pb$^{-1}$ of $W$,
%% $Z$, and if possible, a generic muon sample with a cut)

%% How much computer time does this take?  (per iteration, and how
%% many iterations are necessary?)

%% \section{Special alignments}

%% \subsection{Quick disk alignment}

%% how much data do we need to do this if the
%% chambers and layers are also misaligned?  (With ideal chambers,
%% it's very quick! {\tt :)}

%% MC and MTCC (compare with known x = 7 mm, y = 1 mm in MTCC phase II)

%% \subsection{CSC Layer alignments}

%% what is the nominal procedure, what degrees
%% of freedom can we align, and how much data do we need to do it?

%% MC and MTCC

%% this will probably include Karoly's work: his plots with our results overlaid

%% \section{Beam halo alignment of CSC layers}

%% will we have this before data-taking?

%% New information from Karoly: no problem for inner ring, outer ring may
%% have 0.8 million muons, though heavily emphasizing the inner radius part

%% \section{Systematics studies}

%% \subsection{Dependence on tracker alignment}

%% How does the globalMuon strategy depend on tracker alignment?
%% (Initial studies suggest that the dependence is {\it very} weak.  Is
%% there anything wrong with my studies?)

%% New information: it looks like my procedure is working.  Dependence on
%% tracker alignment is probably {\it very weak!}  I need to pull this
%% together into a coherent story, with plots.

%% \subsection{Dependence on momentum}

%% How does resolution depend on the momentum of the input tracks?
%% Use $J/\psi$s to do an alignment if you have enough; otherwise, just
%% compare width of the residuals distributions.

%% \subsection{Dependence on fitting parameters}

%% What happens if we use different sets of fitting parameters?  I
%% don't see much difference yet, but I haven't tried dropping "y"
%% degrees of freedom.

%% \subsection{Correlation between alignment and calibration}

%% How well does alignment fare if we have a miscalibrated detector?

%% \subsection{``Dependence on tracking algorithm''}

%% \subsubsection{Uncertainty in material distribution}
%% Change the distribution of material in track-fitting but not
%% in SimHit generation to simulate incorrect material
%% description

%% \subsubsection{Uncertainty in magnetic field}

%% Same for magnetic field modeling

%% \subsubsection{Dependence on track charge}

%% How does alignment differ between positive and negative
%% tracks?  Can we cancel the effect by requiring equal
%% populations?

%% \subsubsection{Depdence on the actual algorithm used in tracking}

%% If I'm very adventurous, I may try plugging in different
%% tracking algorithms.  I don't know how easy that is.

%% \subsection{Background studies}

%% Align with realistic backgrounds from CSA07

%% What are the optimized track quality cuts?

%% \section{Conclusion}

%% It works very, very, very well.
